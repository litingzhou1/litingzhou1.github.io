		    <h3>Privacy information de-identification</h3>
		    <span>Data sharing is a key aspect of our lives and the future metaverse concept. Hence it becomes important for image and video data captured from by the user to be shared with organisations, meaning that the design of people’s privacy information de-identification process to preserve an individual’s privacy must not stop at supporting the user in managing her/his present identities. Instead, since any kind of privacy intrusion may have implications on the individual’s future life, it is necessary that we identify and understand the issues related to long term aspects of privacy-enhancing identity management. The work requires the use of various approaches to visual face and screen detection to be compared and enhances to facilitate the removal or alteration of other information that could potentially be used to re-identify an individual in multimedia contents (text, still images, audio and video sequences and their combinations), and the use of controls and safeguards in the data access environment to prevent re-identification. In this project, we will offer some raw human image data and you can use existing techniques to deploy new approaches to face and screen detection and blurring.</li>

			<h3>Individual’s daily routine prediction</h3>
			<span>This work about this proposal is detecting the routine of the daily activities of a person using wearable sensors (including wearable cameras, biometrics and activity detectors). The main work has three main steps. The first step consists in identifying the daily living activities performed by the person. The second step consists in recognizing activity patterns corresponding to a daily routine , while the third step predicts the human activities from the daily activity routine of the person. In this project, we will offer some raw human image and biometric data and you can use existing techniques to deploy new approaches to Individual’s daily routine prediction. </span></li>
